# Minecraft Inventory Generator

This is a tool to generate images of (**currently**) blank minecraft inventories in variable sizes.

## Usage

Either download and compile the source code or the [current release](link to be set) and put it into a folder of your choice.
Open a command line program and navigate to the folder file is saved in. <br>
Run the following command: 
<br>
<br>
``java -jar InventoryGenerator.jar <inventory slot rows> <inventory slot columns>``
<br>
<br>
After execution a file called ``inventoryPreview_<width>_x_<height>.png`` will be created, which is the created inventory.
